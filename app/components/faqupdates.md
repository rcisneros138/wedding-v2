FAQ:

When should I book my room?: 
	If you are certain that you would like to come, please book as soon as possible! 
There is a significant discount for booking rooms with our promo code!

January is peak season in Cancun and the resort cannot guarantee room availability when their inventory fills up. The resort has 440 suites but they book up fast during high season!

 	
What days should I book for?:
	We will be there January 22-26th, 2026 and we would love for you to join us for the entire time! However, this is completely up to you. Our current schedule is: 
Thursday Jan 22: Arrival day. Settle in, explore the resort, and enjoy welcome drinks by the pool
Friday Jan 23: Beach day and rehearsal dinner
Saturday Jan 24: THE BIG DAY
Sunday Jan 25: Recovery brunch and pool party
Monday Jan 26: Departure day


Can I bring my kids?:
	Unfortunately Excellence Resorts are adults-only (18+). But think of it as a chance to sleep in and enjoy cocktails by the pool without worry! 


What is the weather like in Cancun in January?: 
	Absolutely perfect! January is literally the best time to visit Cancun. 
Expect:
Daytime temps of 72-80 degrees F (perfect beach weather) and evening temps of 68-72 degrees F. 
Ocean temps are 80 degrees F (like a warm bath!)
It only rains on average 5 days in January, and very rarely for the entire day. 
Hurricane risk is basically zero (the season ends in November). 

What is the dress code?: 
For the wedding day: Cocktail attire, and bright colors are encouraged! Consider flat shoes for the beach setting. 
For the resort in general: Many of the restaurants at the resort require long pants, skirts, or dresses at dinner. Shorts, flip-flops, tank-tops, and wet clothes are not allowed. However, this of course does not apply when you are at one of the pools or at the beach!

What else should I bring?:
Reef-safe sunscreen
Cash for tips. While not expected, itâ€™s appreciated by the staff. Small bills in USD work great. 
Multiple swim suits! The resort has 6 pools!
Light jacket or wrap. For occasional cool evenings or AC in the restaurants. 
Comfortable walking shoes, in case you decide to go on any excursions. 


How do I get from the airport to the resort?
Cancun International Airport (CUN) is your destination- just 25-30 minutes from the resort!
You have several options: 
Resort shuttle service (recommended!): Excellence provides a free shuttle service through their partner Seasons Tours, and is for guests on the reservation arriving and leaving at the same time. This applies only if you are booking for a minimum of 3 nights. 
Private shuttle companies (not through Excellence): Happy Shuttle Cancun, USA/Canada Transfers, Entertainment Plus. These typically cost around $100 roundtrip. 
Taxi (not our first recommendation): Are available but are more expensive than pre-booked shuttles

What else is there to do in the area?:
Miile Spa (book treatments early!): this spa is on-site, so you do not have to leave the resort
Golf: There are multiple beautiful courses nearby. https://www.excellenceresorts.com/blog/what-are-the-4-best-golf-courses-in-cancun/
Visiting cenotes (natural sinkholes that are amazing to swim in). There are so many along the Yucatan Peninsula. Highly recommend visiting at least one if you are planning on traveling out of the resort!
